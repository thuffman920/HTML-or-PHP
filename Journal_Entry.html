	<p>1 John 1:1</p>
	<p>"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have 
	looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of Life;"</p>
	<p>Exploration:</p>
	<p>We can see that the author is describing himself as an eyewitness to the ministry of Jesus Christ. "From the beginning"
	could refer to Jesus Christ from John 1:1 or could be talking about creation, or many other ideas. But as you will see, 
	most likely the author is referring to God existing from the beginning. The author is bluntly stating that Jesus Christ 
	is eternal (never had a beginning, which can be seen from John 1:1, Psalm 90:2, Ephesians 1:4, Revelations 1:8). This 
	eyewitness author saw Jesus and his miracles, he heard Jesus' sermons and had touched him (maybe a reference back to 
	Thomas touching the hands, feet and side of the real resurrected body of Jesus). So, the author is stating that his 
	account outlined in the succeeding verses were outlined by Jesus Christ or more precisely, God himself. The author also
	recognizes that the doctrine outline by Jesus Christ was the "Word of Life." "Word of Life" refers back to John 1:1,4,14.
	In these verses, we can see that the "Word of Life" is a collection of truthful guidelines that everyone should live 
	their lives around, since God is our creator and is omniscient (all-knowing).</p>
	<p>Application:</p>
	<p>These things play a huge rule in our lives because <sup>1</sup>if God did not know everything, then he could not 
	determine the right path for us (individually) and <sup>2</sup>we should not turn our backs on the person that willingly
	and lovingly created us. For example, if you create a computer program, then the program will only output what the 
	creator put into it, willingly. So, in order to make a good program the creator has to have a large range of computer
	science knowledge to make it run correctly. Thus it seems logical for us to follow the knowledge laid out for us, 
	lovingly, from our Creator on how to live a fruitful life. That comes through a daily devotion to reading AND studying 
	the Word of the Lord, daily.</p>
	<p><h3>January 29, 2015</h3></p>
	<p>1 John 1:2</p>
	<p>"(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was
	with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)"</p>
	<p>Exploration:</p>
	<p>If you refer back to yesterday's journal entry, we find that this verse is expounding upon his previous statement.
	Because he used the word "life," which is the same Greek word ("zo-a") that is in verse 1. The word "it" is referring to
	the free gift bestowed by God, which is an eternal resting place with the Almighty God (John 17:3). The author is trying
	to explain to us that salvation is a very important aspect of our lives, it gives us an assurance that one day we will
	live with God forever, assuming that we completely turn our lives over to him. It becomes clear why the author is writing
	this letter to us. It seems that the audience is directed at everyone even the author himself. It is very interesting
	that the author states that eternal life "was with the Father" (a past tense verb "was"), which, hypothetically speaking,
	seems to mean that Jesus is eternal life. This makes sense because in the context of the previous entry, Jesus did not 
	have a beginning (or was not created), meaning Jesus is eternal. But also, physically, Jesus is eternal life because he
	died a brutal death and rose again after three days in order to pay for our sins and our wrong doings.</p>
	<p>Application:</p>
	<p>The important step for our life is receiving the perfect gift bestowed by God, through the sacrificial price
	Jesus paid. Without this gift, a person is doomed to eternal punishment (Matthew 25:46). So Christians, it is 
	necessary to proclaim this gift to other people which have not received this gift. But, also, this gift did not come 
	free, a perfect person had to die in order to cover our sins. So, this gift should not be taken lightly, God deserves 
	everything we have and much, MUCH more.</p>
	<p><h3>January 30, 2015</h3></p>
	<p>1 John 1:3</p>
	<p>"That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our 
	fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."</p>
	<p>Exploration:</p>
	<p>It seems that the author has repeated himself for the third time. When someone states something more than two times
	then it must be very important. The author is stressing that his letter is an eyewitness account about the free gift that
	Jesus has bestowed upon us. At the time that he was writing (60 to 70 A.D.), there were gospels and other letters that
	were being printed and circulated about. So, determining if a letter was inspired by God (2 Timothy 3:16), the author 
	preferably should be an eyewitness to Jesus, or even better, a disciple of Jesus. So instead of penning his name to this
	document, he is pointing out how the letter is written by a follower of Jesus, maybe a disciple. He is also pointing
	out his effort to teach other followers the doctrine and ways of Jesus as he was commissioned (Matthew 28:20). He is 
	urging the reader to have "fellowship", which comes from the Greek word "koinonia" meaning "partnership, participation, 
	or benefaction." In other words, Christians should meet together in partnership in order to grow for the Lord. The author
	understands that the ultimate fellowship is with the Lord.</p>
	<p>Application:</p>
	<p>In fellowship with fellow Christians, we have to help, encourage and strengthen each other so that we all can grow in
	the Lord. As the saying goes, "there is strength in numbers" follows truly in the spiritual realm. A group of accountable
	Christians will grow better than any "one" Christian could do on their own. The true and ultimate fellowship is with the
	Lord. A true fellowship is an openly prayer life and a significant time spent with God, in meditation. This ultimate
	fellowship is extremely hard to reach and/or maintain, but when we accomplish it, the reward is far greater than anything
	we could ever own, greater than silver and gold.</p>

	<p>1 John 1:4</p>
	<p><sup>4</sup>"And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full."</p>
